I saw that I was my father and I was trying to help him with stuff and my brother was a menace not seeing thru the pain in his eyes. I forgave my father for what happened, he was too stuck on the bad things and he failed to see the beauty he had. Iâ€™m like a flower blooming, ready to give love and happiness.
