### Lyrics
	Once upon a time,
	I was feeling lost, nowhere to go
	only thing was pushing me was my internal compass.
	Away from home, nowhere i belong.
	My heart is my home and i take it everywhere i go

Based on your notes, it seems like you are working on a project related to music and dreams. To create a good amount of motion blur for this project, the best setting would be to focus on capturing the essence of movement and fluidity in the music track "Music and Dreams." This can be achieved by incorporating dynamic elements that convey a sense of motion and dream-like qualities in your visual representation.
